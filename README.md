# Data Visualization with ggplot2
This repository contains the code and data for the "Data Visualization with ggplot2" chapter in Hadley Wickham's book "R for Data Science".

## Introduction
In this project, I have completed all the exercises in the "Data Visualization with ggplot2" chapter of the book "R Graphics Cookbook". The goal of this project was to practice creating visualizations using the ggplot2 package in R, and to explore the different ways in which data can be visualized using this powerful package.

## Data
The data used in this project comes from a variety of sources, including built-in datasets in R, external datasets, and simulated datasets. Each dataset is provided in a separate CSV file in the "data" folder of this repository.

## Code
The code for each exercise is provided in a separate R chunk in the quarto abd R files of this repository. Each script file is named after the exercise number, and contains the code necessary to produce the visualization for that exercise.

In addition to the code for each exercise, I have also provided a "setup.R" file that contains the code necessary to install and load the required packages and to set the working directory to the root of the project. This file should be run before running any of the exercise scripts.

Conclusion
This project has been a great way to practice using the ggplot2 package in R, and to explore the different ways in which data can be visualized using this powerful package. I hope that this repository can serve as a useful resource for anyone looking to improve their data visualization skills using R and ggplot2.
