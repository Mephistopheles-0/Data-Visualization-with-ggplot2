# Data Visualization with ggplot2
This repository contains the code and data for the "Data Visualization with ggplot2" chapter in Hadley Wickham's book "R for Data Science".

## Introduction
In this project, I have completed all the exercises in the "Data Visualization with ggplot2" chapter of the book "R Graphics Cookbook". The goal of this project was to practice creating visualizations using the ggplot2 package in R, and to explore the different ways in which data can be visualized using this powerful package.

## Code
The code for each exercise is provided in a separate R chunk in the quarto abd R file of this repository. 

## About the book
<code>R4DS</code> teaches you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.

##Conclusion
This project has been a great way to practice using the ggplot2 package in R, and to explore the different ways in which data can be visualized using this powerful package. I hope that this repository can serve as a useful resource for anyone looking to improve their data visualization skills using R and ggplot2.
